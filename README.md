#Computer Graphics  

This project is part of my exploration with Computer Graphics. 

This project is an implementation of Ray Tracing algorithm. The idea behind this project is to perform Ray Tracing and generate an image that should mimic the world as realistically as possible.

I implemented illumination with ambient light, point light and added reflected ray. This program does not support transparent object.

Here's the generated image:
